# Expand phase: prepare database for new schema (e.g., add new columns, tables)
# These changes should be backward compatible with the old application version
# expand: echo 'Running expand phase command...'

# Migrate phase: core schema changes (e.g., data transformations, constraints)
# Application should typically be stopped during this phase
# migrate: kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:latest

# Contract phase: remove old schema elements no longer needed
# Only run after confirming the new application version is working
# contract: echo 'Running contract phase command...'

# Post phase: validation and testing commands
# These commands verify the deployment was successful
# post: curl -f http://myapp/health
