# Expand phase: prepare database for new schema (e.g., add new columns, tables)
# These changes should be backward compatible with the old application version
expand: echo 'Running expand phase command'

# Migrate phase: core schema changes (e.g., data transformations, constraints)
# Application should typically be stopped during this phase
migrate: echo 'Running migrate phase command'

# Contract phase: remove old schema elements no longer needed
# Only run after confirming the new application version is working
contract: echo 'Running contract phase command'

# Post phase: validation and testing commands
# These commands verify the deployment was successful
post: echo 'Running post-deployment validation'
